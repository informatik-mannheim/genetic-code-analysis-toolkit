<p>The &quot;<b>Find</b>&quot; functionality can be used for searching for some patterns in a sequence.
<p>Depending on the &quot;<b>Direction</b>&quot; switch the search is performed either from top to bottom, or from bottom to top, starting at the current position of the cursor in the sequence. The option &quot;<b>Wrap Search</b>&quot; can be used to begin the search from the start of the sequence provided that the end was reached without result. As soon as a match was found the sequence will be selected and highlighted in the editor.
<p>By default the search input admits solely single nucleotide bases. For a more complex search, regular expressions can be used by enabling the &quot;<b>Regular Expression</b>&quot; checkbox. Any combination of the constructs listed in the following table can be used for the search for a given pattern.

<p>To match e.g. all codons (tuples of length 3) ending in U, the regular expression <b>??U</b> may be used. For tessera (tuples of length 4) starting with U and ending either in A or C the regular expression <b>U??(A|C)</b> applies.
