<p>This operation removes tuples which contain unknown symbols or are not valid (compare tessera).
<p>Unknown tuples are displayed as <span style="background-color:#B0B0B0">UNK</span> in the compound display. For instance codons (tuples of length three), unknown tuples are those not coding an amino acid, for tessera (tuples of length four), all valid 4-nucleotides which are not valid tessera (nonsense) will be removed.
<p><b>Example:</b><table class="example">
	<tr><td>Input sequence:</td><td>ACA AAX XCU UAU GAG</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Output sequence:</td><td>ACA UAU GAG</td></tr>
