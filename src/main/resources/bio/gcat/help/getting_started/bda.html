<p>BDA Tool is a part of the Genetic Code Analysis Toolkit aimed to create and modify Binary Dichotomic Algorithms as described in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264714002044">On Models of the Genetic Code generated by Binary Dichotomic Algorithms</a> by M.Gumbel, E.Fimmel, A.Danielli and L.Str&uuml;ngmann in BioSystems 128 (2015).
<p>A BDA-generated model is based on a set of binary dichotomic algorithms (BDAs) chosen. A BDA partitions the set of 64 codons into two disjoint classes of size 32 each and provides a generalization of known partitions like the Rumer dichotomy.
<p>The BDA tool starts by pressing the <img src="bda.png"> in the Analysis Tool. A BDA can be loaded and saved using the buttons in the toolbar of the BDA tool. The BDA given can be edited by using the items next to the display of the BDA. While changing the BDA the class table shows the partitioning performed by the BDA.
