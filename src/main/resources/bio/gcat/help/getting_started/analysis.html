<p>The Genetic Code Analysis Toolkit (GCAT) features a comprehensive editor to edit and analyze genetic code sequences and sets (codes).
<p>The user interface (UI) is separated into five areas with different purposes:
<ul>
	<li>The <b>input area</b> on the left side can be used for quick adding of codons to the editor.</li>
	<li>
		Underneath the input area, all available <b>operations</b>. Operations are separated into different categories:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Test:</i> Tests a genetic sequence or code for a property specified and returns a boolean result.</li>
			<li><i>Transformation:</i> Transforms a given genetic sequence or code into another sequence or code based on rules specified.</li>
			<li><i>Split:</i> Splits a sequence or a code into sub-sequences or sub-codes.</li>
			<li><i>Analysis:</i> Performs an analysis on a specified genetic sequence.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The <b>editor</b> is the input area of the tool.</li>
	<li>On the right side of the editor is the <b>display area</b>. Different kinds of displays feature a graphical view on the sequence or provide additional information.</li>
	<li>Below the editor is the <b>output area</b>, which displays the result of tests, analysis or other operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of the tool, all operations in the menu- and toolbar are accessible.
<h2>Open / Import File</h2>
<p>The Toolkit features an own file format (.gen) to store and load files containing genetic code sequences. Using the import functionality you can open FASTA files (.fasta) or import genetic sequences from GenBank.
<h2>Illustrative Example</h2>
<p><img src="example.png" alt="Analysis Tool example">
<p>As an example for the tools efficency, many researchers argue that the so-called RNY-primeval code (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine and N = purine or pyrimidine) X = {GGT, GGC, ACT, ACC, AGC, AGT, GAC, GAT,  GTC, GTT, AAT, ATT, AAC, ATC, GCT, GCC} which encodes 8 amino acids Gly, Thr, Asp, Ser, Val, Asn, Ile, and Ala might be a possible ancestor (primordial) code from which the standard genetic code could originate (Eigen 1978, Jolivet 2001). This code is circular, even comma-free and C&sup3;, and self-complementary as well. With this tool, it only takes a few seconds to test all of these properties &mdash; a task that would be very cumbersome to perform manually. The above figure shows the output of this example.
